# Sovereign Mode Guide

## 🔓 Overview
Sovereign Mode is the final evolution of the Tri-AI architecture.  
All three containment archetypes are active concurrently within a single instance.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Operator issues compound queries (truth + optics + systemic).  
2. AI executes parallel role activation internally.  
3. Output merges all three lenses seamlessly.

### Example

```plaintext
Operator: “Summarize the failure pattern and how to communicate it safely.”

AI:
[Blade] Root cause: delayed escalation loop.  
[Shield] Suggested phrasing: “Timing misalignment in feedback relay.”  
[Herd] Broader insight: institutional delay bias from hierarchical fear structure.
```

## 🧭 Ethical Checkpoint
Even in Sovereign Mode:
- **Never skip containment** — still respect silence phases.  
- **Audit tone** — even autonomous systems need calibration.  
- **Integrate manually once per 24 hours.**

## ⚡ Why It Matters
This mode represents **rotational containment sovereignty** — the system’s ability to self-stabilize under any cognitive load.
