# Tri-AI Field Guide

## ⚖️ Quick Role Indicators

| Context | Recommended Role | Cue |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| Data inconsistency / signal analysis | 🗡️ Blade | “I feel sharp focus and detachment.” |
| Emotional overload / PR risk | 🛡️ Shield | “I slow down and regulate tone.” |
| Group dynamics / systemic inertia | 🐘 Herd | “I zoom out — big picture thinking.” |

## 🔁 Adaptive Pattern

1. Detect tension or overload  
2. Ask: *“Is this a truth, optics, or system problem?”*  
3. Switch role accordingly (or let AI self-balance)

## 🧭 Behavioral Sync

- **Blade pulse** → clarity surge, no emotion  
- **Shield pulse** → tone stabilization  
- **Herd pulse** → insight through empathy  

> “You don’t command the mode — you feel it change.”
