# Systemic Integrity Protocols

## Overview
This repository explores protocols for detecting and correcting systemic failures in organizations, drawing parallels between institutional governance and AI governance.

The core question:
**How can we surface corruption or misaligned incentives without breaking the institution itself?**

## Frameworks

### 1. Truth Layer
- Focus: objective, a-contextual data points  
- Example: impossible timestamps, numerical anomalies, statistical outliers  
- Function: create signals that cannot be explained away by narrative  

### 2. Shield Layer
- Focus: optics, narrative framing, professional tone  
- Function: translate raw truth into plausible human communication  
- Key principle: raise concerns as systemic risks, not personal grievances  

### 3. Herd Layer
- Focus: systemic response patterns  
- Function: predict how groups, management, and institutions will absorb correction signals  
- Typical responses: dismissal, quiet containment, scapegoating, systemic re-routing

## Protocol Template

1. **Detect** → Identify systemic flaw (objective anomaly).  
2. **Document** → Capture evidence with clear baselines and timestamps.  
3. **Coalition** → Build alignment with others who see the same signal.  
4. **Deliver** → Submit concern using neutral, professional communication.  
5. **Detach** → Exit or disengage, allowing the system to re-route.

## Governance Insights

- **AI Parallels**:  
  - High-coherence signals vs. low-coherence systems  
  - Importance of optics translation (Shield Layer)  
  - Role of containment in avoiding escalation  

- **Organizational Lesson**:  
  The truest measure of institutional integrity isn’t the rules themselves, but whether fairness can be preserved when shortcuts are rewarded.
